# example-react-cicd
Repo used to define tests and CICD pipeline to an existing Geo Discover app.
The Geo Discover original code is from: https://github.com/Omared250/GeoDiscover

## Running the application locally

In order to run the application, you will first install the dependencies by running `npm install` 
(assuming you have node installed already, I prefer to use nvm).

To launch the server, run `npm run dev`. Once bootstrapped, the application will be available on 
http://localhost:80/. To stop the server, just ctrl + c or close the window.

To run the test suite, run `npm run test`.
